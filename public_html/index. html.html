    <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no defined cause of Autism, however, we do have some theories. Recent studies suggest that Autism is genetically inherited and caused by over-connectivity in the brain. This essentially means that there are too many connections being made amongst neurons, which can cause mis-firings, or weaker connections in separate areas of the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this may sound daunting to some, this does not mean that an Autism diagnosis should be seen as a sentence of despair. Rather, it is a good starting point to learn more about the ways in which our brains are diverse and as a tool to learn how to accommodate for the differences we experience.
    </p>

<!-- The Autism Spectrum -->
<div class="container">
    <h2>What is the Autism Spectrum?</h2>
    <p>
        Autism is defined as a spectrum disorder because of the varying experiences, abilities, and severeties and types of symptoms or traits one has. It it not soley about how "Autistically" a person presents, ranging from mild to severe. The Spectrum we refer to is not linear at all, instead, appearing more like a color wheel, with each color being a different trait, and the hue an expression of how intensely that trait is experienced, or expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a popular saying amongst those who are Autistic: "If you've met one individual with Autism, you've met ONE individual with Autism". We are all very different and experience the world differently, just as everyone else. Not everyone likes chocolate cake, so to state that liking chocolate cake is a defining quality that all humans have in order to be human, would be inherintly false. We cannot define all people with Autism by traits individual to each Autistic person. Thus, we have used the spectrum model to help describe the variety we can appreciate in Autistic people.

    </p>
</div>

<!-- Support Needs -->
<div class="container">
    <h2>What are Support Needs?</h2>
    <p>
        If we don't use a linear spectrum to define the severity of Autstic symptoms, then how do we express it? We used to use terms like "high" and "low" functioning, "mild" and "severe" and Apergers vs Autism to express these differences, but we professionals as well as the Autistic community have moved away from these terms as we learn more about it. Autism is now defined by the support needs an individual has. The more support an individual needs, the higher the level of their support-needs! These levels are attatched to the diagnosis and appear as Autism 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being the lowest support-needs, and 3 being the highest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why have we made this change? Because ALL levels of Autism need support, even if that need for support is lower than another person's. Aspergers used to be the title given to Autistics who were belived to be "high-functioning". This meant that people with that label were not recieving the support they needed. Aspergers, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, and Autism are all part of the Autism Spectrum and all require support, even if the support seems minimal. It's helpful to those who have been diagnosed to use one label so we can all access accommodations and support.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also want to add a brief note acknowleging the problematic history of Aspergers as a label specifically. Hans Asperger, of whom Aspergers is named after, was a pediatrician in Vienna in the 1930's-40s. For the sake of transparency, yes, he is believed to have had ties to the Nazi party and was an integral part of the euthanasia of disabled children. I do not want to elaborate further, as I want this website to be a place that is safe to those who want to learn more about Autism and how we can celebrate it rather than demonize it. Nevertheless, I HIGHLY encourage learning more about this problematic past as it does us no good to sweep it under the rug. We must acknowledge our mistakes as humans and do better as best as we can.

<!-- Autism Myth Busting -->
<div class="container">
    <h2>Autism Myth Busting</h2>
    <p>
        1. Autism is caused by Vaccines - This is false. Not only has it been discredited largely by the medical community, but new research actually suggests that Autism is aquired through genetic links, and not the ingredients of a vaccine. Vaccines help us to protect our communities from disease. The best reason to avoid vaccination are allergies and immune system deficiencies, not to avoid Autism! (because that wouldn't work anyway)
        2. Autism is a disease - Autism is a disorder. Autism is a disability. Autism is a condition. While it is true that Autism can present many challenges to an individual's life, it is not a disease. Disease is defined as any harmful deviation from the normal structural or functional state of an organism, generally associated with certain signs and symptoms and differing in nature from physical injury. Autism IS the normal state of those who have it. It may not be TYPICAL, but it is not a sickness, lethal, or harmful. It is a normal part of diversity in a large population.
        3. Autism needs to be cured - Autism needs to be ACCOMMODATED. There is no cure for autism, and we don't need one. Autism does not hurt us, a world that is not built for us hurts us.
        4. Autism is a mental illness - Autism is a developmental disability. Autism can make us more prone to mental illness, but it is not one itself. With the right support and accommodation, Autistic people can life happy, fulfilling lives.
        5. Autism only occurs in the male population - False. The diagnostic criteria for autism was researched heavily in young males, leaving the female population largely missed for diagnosis. Current research shows that rates in both sides of the binary are actually close to equal.
        6. Autism is only a children's disorder - While it seems like only children are diagnosed with Autism, many people get diagnosed later in life as well. People don't grow out of Autism, they learn coping mechanisms and to adapt. Autism is developmental, meaning it persists through development. Autistic children become Autistic adults.
        7. Autism has a "look" - Autism is actually known as an invisible disability, meaning you won't notice it upon first glance. Autism is an internal experience. The biggest contributing physical feature to having Autism is a brain. We can see how it manifests in brain scans, but we cannot see Autism in a person's looks. People of all shapes, sizes, sexes, ethnicities, cultures, and features can be Autistic.
        8. All Autistic people like trains - Stereotypes affect all minority communities, including Autistic people. Remember, Autistic people are individuals just like anyone else. Autistic people can like trains, just as much as they can dislike them, or have no opinion. Liking trains is not part of the diagnostic criteria.
        9. Autistic people are dangerous - Autistic people are more likely to be victims of violence or abuse than to be the perpetrators. Yes, some Autistic people have been violent, abusive, or destructive. If you look at any group of people, you will find those characteristics. It is not a diagnostic feature.
        10. Autism is separate from the person - Autism colors the way we experience our life. It impacts our communication and social relationships, it influences our senses, it dictates how deeply we love our interests, it sways our emotions, it challenges our nervous system. Autism is intrinsic to our experience of life. It can be as much an identity as it is a condition.
