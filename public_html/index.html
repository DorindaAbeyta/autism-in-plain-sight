    <h2 id="section-1-header">What is Autism?</h2>
        <div class="p-width">
            <p class="p-3 mx-1">
                Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurological condition that manifests in a range of unique traits and characteristics. It is important to understand these traits to gain a better understanding of the experiences of individuals on the autism spectrum.The DSM-5 defines Autism Spectrum Disorder as a condition characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. However, it is important to note that autism is a spectrum, and individuals with ASD can exhibit a wide range of strengths, challenges, and abilities.

        <p class="col-lg-4">
            There is no defined cause of Autism, however, we do have some theories. Recent studies suggest that Autism is genetically inherited and caused by over-connectivity in the brain. This essentially means that there are too many connections being made amongst neurons, which can cause mis-firings, or weaker connections in separate areas of the brain.
            While this may sound daunting to some, this does not mean that an Autism diagnosis should be seen as a sentence of despair. Rather, it is a good starting point to learn more about the ways in which our brains are diverse and as a tool to learn how to accommodate for the differences we experience.

            Social communication difficulties are a core aspect of autism. People on the autism spectrum may have challenges with nonverbal communication, such as maintaining eye contact, interpreting facial expressions, and understanding social cues. They may also struggle with verbal communication, such as using and understanding language, engaging in reciprocal conversations, or adjusting their communication style based on social context.
        </p>
        <p>
            Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities are another characteristic of autism. This can include repetitive movements (such as hand-flapping or rocking), a strong adherence to routines or rituals, intense fixations on specific topics or objects, or sensory sensitivities. These traits often provide individuals with a sense of predictability and comfort in their environment.

            It is important to remember that autism is not defined solely by these diagnostic criteria. Autistic individuals have unique strengths and talents that can vary greatly from person to person. Many individuals with autism possess remarkable attention to detail, exceptional memory, creativity, and expertise in specific areas of interest. These strengths contribute to the diverse contributions and perspectives of individuals on the autism spectrum.

            It is also crucial to recognize that autism is a lifelong condition. While individuals may receive support and develop coping strategies, autism is an integral part of their identity. By fostering acceptance and understanding, we can create an inclusive society that values and supports the diverse needs and abilities of individuals with autism.

<!-- The Autism Spectrum -->
<section>
<div class="container-lg blue-spectrum">
    <h2 id="spectrum" class="rounded-4">What is the Autism Spectrum?</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3">
    <p>
        Autism is defined as a spectrum disorder because of the varying experiences, abilities, and severeties or traits one has. It it not soley about how "Autistically" a person presents, ranging from mild to severe. You are either on the spectrum, or off. There is no such thing as having more or less Autism. To visualize this, think of a color wheel, with each color being a different trait, and the hue an expression of how intensely that trait is experienced, or expressed. This model of the spectrum recognizes that autism is not a one-size-fits-all condition. The characteristics and challenges associated with autism may change as individuals grow and develop.

    </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-6">

    <div class="col-lg-3">
    <p>
        There is a popular saying amongst those who are Autistic: "If you've met one individual with Autism, you've met ONE individual with Autism".  Some individuals on the spectrum may excel in specific areas, such as pattern recognition, attention to detail, or creative thinking. Others may face challenges in areas such as social communication, sensory sensitivities, or changes in routine. The concept of the spectrum also highlights the fluidity and development of autism over time. Early interventions, supportive environments, and individual strengths can all influence an individual's progress and quality of life.

<!-- Support Needs -->
<section>
<div class="container-lg yellow-needs rounded-4 mt-5">
    <h2 id="support-needs">What are Support Needs?</h2>
    <p>
        If we don't use a linear spectrum to define the severity of Autstic symptoms, then how do we express it? We used to use terms like "high" and "low" functioning, "mild" and "severe" and Apergers vs Autism to express these differences, but we professionals as well as the Autistic community have moved away from these terms as we learn more about it. Autism is now defined by the support needs an individual has. The more support an individual needs, the higher the level of their support-needs! These levels are attatched to the diagnosis and appear as Autism 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being the lowest support-needs, and 3 being the highest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why have we made this change? Because ALL levels of Autism need support, even if that need for support is lower than another person's. Aspergers used to be the title given to Autistics who were belived to be "high-functioning". This meant that people with that label were not recieving the support they needed. Aspergers, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, and Autism are all part of the Autism Spectrum and all require support, even if the support seems minimal. It's helpful to those who have been diagnosed to use one label so we can all access accommodations and support.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also want to add a brief note acknowleging the problematic history of Aspergers as a label specifically. Hans Asperger, of whom Aspergers is named after, was a pediatrician in Vienna in the 1930's-40s. For the sake of transparency, yes, he is believed to have had ties to the Nazi party and was an integral part of the euthanasia of disabled children. I do not want to elaborate further, as I want this website to be a place that is safe to those who want to learn more about Autism and how we can celebrate it rather than demonize it. Nevertheless, I HIGHLY encourage learning more about this problematic past as it does us no good to sweep it under the rug. We must acknowledge our mistakes as humans and do better as best as we can.

                    Autistic people do experience empathy! Sometimes, we experience higher levels of empathy than most. Often, this misconception comes from a misunderstanding of how Autistic people show empathy. We may not be able to express it the way people expect us to, or may be too overwhelmed and shut down. Just like anything else in Autism, it is individual and on a spectrum.

                    Autism is defined by a deficit in social communication, but a deficit doesn't always mean a lack of. Often, Autistic people have different ways of communicating that deviates from what is considered to be typical. Whether it is by an AAC, sign-language, or behaviors, even non-speaking Autistics communicate. Remember, we all had to develop spoken communication, but it is not the only form of communication we use.

        The visibility and representation of autism in the media play a vital role in promoting understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity.The media often perpetuates stereotypes and misconceptions about autism. By increasing visibility and representation, we can challenge these stereotypes and dispel myths surrounding autism. Accurate portrayals of individuals on the autism spectrum can help educate the public, foster empathy, and encourage a more accurate understanding of the condition. When autistic individuals see themselves represented positively and authentically in the media, it sends a powerful message of acceptance and inclusion. It helps individuals on the autism spectrum feel seen, valued, and included in society. Stigma and discrimination often arise from a lack of understanding or fear of the unknown. By increasing visibility and representation, we can humanize autism and challenge the negative perceptions that lead to stigmatization and discrimination.

            Autism Pride, as defined by actual autistic individuals, is a movement that aims to celebrate and embrace the identity, strengths, and experiences of autistic people. It focuses on shifting the narrative around autism from one of deficits and challenges to one that acknowledges and values the unique perspectives and abilities of autistic individuals. It encourages autistic individuals to embrace their neurodivergent identities and take pride in who they are, promoting the understanding that being autistic is not something to be ashamed of or to be "cured." Instead, it recognizes autism as an integral part of an individual's identity, shaping their thoughts, perceptions, and experiences. This includes advocating for accommodations and support systems that allow autistic individuals to thrive and participate fully in society. The movement also aims to amplify the voices of autistic individuals, ensuring that their perspectives and experiences are recognized, valued, and included in discussions and decisions that affect their lives. Autism Pride embraces the diversity within the autism community, recognizing that each autistic individual is unique, with their own strengths, challenges, and interests. It is important to note that the Autism Pride movement is not intended to diminish or dismiss the challenges faced by autistic individuals. Rather, it seeks to reframe the narrative surrounding autism, focusing on strengths, talents, and the potential for growth and fulfillment.

            It is important to note that not all autistic individuals have the same preferences or opinions, as the autism community is diverse and composed of individuals with varied perspectives. However, some autistic individuals and advocacy groups prefer the infinity symbol as a representation of autism rather than the puzzle piece. The infinity symbol emphasizes the concept of personhood and identity. Autistic individuals view themselves as whole people with infinite potential, thoughts, and experiences. They seek recognition and acceptance as individuals rather than being defined by a missing piece of a puzzle.
            <br>
            The puzzle piece symbol has been associated with autism for many years, but it has also been criticized for several reasons. Some autistic individuals feel that the puzzle piece implies a sense of incompleteness or brokenness, suggesting that they are somehow incomplete or need to be "fixed." The infinity symbol, on the other hand, focuses on the strengths, abilities, and infinite possibilities of autistic individuals.
