<div class="container">
    <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is no defined cause of Autism, however, we do have some theories. Recent studies suggest that Autism is genetically inherited and caused by over-connectivity in the brain. This essentially means that there are too many connections being made amongst neurons, which can cause mis-firings, or weaker connections in separate areas of the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this may sound daunting to some, this does not mean that an Autism diagnosis should be seen as a sentence of despair. Rather, it is a good starting point to learn more about the ways in which our brains are diverse and as a tool to learn how to accommodate for the differences we experience.
    </p>
</div>

<!-- The Autism Spectrum -->
<div class="container">
    <h2>What is the Autism Spectrum?</h2>
    <p>
        Autism is defined as a spectrum disorder because of the varying experiences, abilities, and severeties and types of symptoms or traits one has. It it not soley about how "Autistically" a person presents, ranging from mild to severe. The Spectrum we refer to is not linear at all, instead, appearing more like a color wheel, with each color being a different trait, and the hue an expression of how intensely that trait is experienced, or expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a popular saying amongst those who are Autistic: "If you've met one individual with Autism, you've met ONE individual with Autism". We are all very different and experience the world differently, just as everyone else. Not everyone likes chocolate cake, so to state that liking chocolate cake is a defining quality that all humans have in order to be human, would be inherintly false. We cannot define all people with Autism by traits individual to each Autistic person. Thus, we have used the spectrum model to help describe the variety we can appreciate in Autistic people.

    </p>
</div>

<!-- Support Needs -->
<div class="container">
    <h2>What are Support Needs?</h2>
    <p>
        If we don't use a linear spectrum to define the severity of Autstic symptoms, then how do we express it? We used to use terms like "high" and "low" functioning, "mild" and "severe" and Apergers vs Autism to express these differences, but we professionals as well as the Autistic community have moved away from these terms as we learn more about it. Autism is now defined by the support needs an individual has. The more support an individual needs, the higher the level of their support-needs! These levels are attatched to the diagnosis and appear as Autism 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being the lowest support-needs, and 3 being the highest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why have we made this change? Because ALL levels of Autism need support, even if that need for support is lower than another person's. Aspergers used to be the title given to Autistics who were belived to be "high-functioning". This meant that people with that label were not recieving the support they needed. Aspergers, Pervasive Developmental Disorder, and Autism are all part of the Autism Spectrum and all require support, even if the support seems minimal. It's helpful to those who have been diagnosed to use one label so we can all access accommodations and support.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also want to add a brief note acknowleging the problematic history of Aspergers as a label specifically. Hans Asperger, of whom Aspergers is named after, was a pediatrician in Vienna in the 1930's-40s. For the sake of transparency, yes, he is believed to have had ties to the Nazi party and was an integral part of the euthanasia of disabled children. I do not want to elaborate further, as I want this website to be a place that is safe to those who want to learn more about Autism and how we can celebrate it rather than demonize it. Nevertheless, I HIGHLY encourage learning more about this problematic past as it does us no good to sweep it under the rug. We must acknowledge our mistakes as humans and do better as best as we can.

                Autism is caused by Vaccines - This is false.

Vaccines help us to protect our communities from disease. The best reason to avoid vaccination are allergies and immune system deficiencies, not to avoid Autism! (because that wouldn't work anyway)
