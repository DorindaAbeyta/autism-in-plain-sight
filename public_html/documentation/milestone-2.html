<h1 class="text-success bg-dark">Autism in Plain Sight</h1>
<h2 class="text-success bg-dark">Content Strategy</h2>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Home Page</h3>
<p><strong>Header:</strong> The title, <strong>Autism in Plain Sight</strong> along with an animation that looks like neurons changing colors. Would love to be able to make it interact as someone mouses over it if possible, but that might be difficult. (I liked J. Ryan Henson's animation from the PWP gallery)
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Navbar:</strong> Navigation drop down to each section of the website so people can easily jump around without having to scroll, and an accessibility option for light or dark mode.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Home Section:</strong> A brief, friendly introduction to my website that explains its purpose: serving as a brochure for the friends and family of autistic people to learn about autism.
</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 1: What is Autism?</h3>
    <p>This section will discuss how autism affects the brain, as well as a short overview of the diagnostic criteria. I want to explain the criteria in a way that is readable to the average person so they can understand and digest it. (The DSM criteria is often daunting and overly clinical, which can cause confusion.) I want to include an illustration of an autistic brain scan. </p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 2: What is the Autism Spectrum?</h3>
    <p>A brief description of what it means when we say the Autism Spectrum: What it actually is and with a little diagram of a color-wheel to give a visual example </p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 3: Defining Support Needs</h3>
    <p>Outlining what Autism 1, 2, and 3 are, and explaining why it's better to use a descriptor of support needs instead of functioning labels, and why we don't use the term Aspergers anymore.</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 4: Autism Myth Busting</h3>
    <p>Debunking common Autism myths such as the gender bias, vaccine propaganda, the confusion between and intellectual, learning, and developmental disability, I want this section to be able to be swiped through to make it easier to read.</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 5: Visibility and Representation</h3>
    <p>A brief paragraph or two summarizing that good visibility and representation of Autism guides us away from harmful stereotypes and to acceptance.</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 6: Notable Autistics</h3>
    <p>A carousel of images and descriptions of famous or notable Autistics and their accomplishments.</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 7: Autistic Characters</h3>
    <p>A carousel of images and descriptions of characters in media that portray autism well, according to the viewers in the Autistic community. This will include both confirmed Autistic characters, and those that are Autistic-coded or head cannoned. (Like Spock and Data from Star Trek)</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 8: Autism Pride</h3>
    <p>A closing summary that explains autistic pride: a concept that means to push back on cures, harmful fear-mongering, or hiding and instead brings acceptance into the forefront. I want to include an image of the autism pride symbol, the multi-color infinity symbol, replacing the puzzle piece symbol associated with autism.</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Section 9: Helpful Links</h3>
    <p>A list of links that redirect to charities, foundations, and helpful platforms for Autism education, acceptance, and resources.</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Footer</h3>
    <p>My name and links.</p>
<h3 class="text-success bg-dark">Inspiration</h3>
    <p>Saw this webpage from the Autism Society when I was researching. Although there are things I will do differently, I thought their layout was pretty nice, and helped me visualize how I can fit a lot of information on a single page website without it being overwhelming or look cluttered.
