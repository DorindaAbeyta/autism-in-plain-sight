<h1 class="text-info bg-dark">Autism in Plain Sight</h1>
<h2 class="text-info bg-dark">Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
    <h3 class="text-info bg-dark">Purpose</h3>
        <p>My personal website project will be a place I can direct people to, with the goal of helping me to explain autism to them. I often find that when I talk to people about it, they do not know very much about autism and the many ways it can present, often only knowing about the stereotypes that the media uses when portraying autism. My hope is that this website can increase awareness and visibility for autistic people who do not fit the stereotypes, which can be exclusionary in providing support for women and people of color on the spectrum. Ideally, it will be able to function as an online-pamphlet that other autistics can use, not just me!</p>
    <h3 class="text-info bg-dark">Audience</h3>
        <p>The ideal audience of this website would be… anyone, really. I want it to be simple and user-friendly enough that it is helpful to anyone who reads it. Family, friends, co-workers, anyone who interacts with an autistic person daily.  As an educational online-pamphlet, I want the website to be accessible to anyone who would be using it.</p>
    <h3 class="text-info bg-dark">Goal</h3>
        <p>Aside from educating peers, a goal I want to accomplish with my website is making accessibility and user-friendly code to show off to future employers. I’m a creative person and want to use code as another avenue to express my creativity. Building a website that has an aesthetically appealing, user-friendly design, would be a good way to show off my skillset to work toward a career creating front-end user interfaces in a creative company such as Meow Wolf, or a UI/UX focused career with emphasis on accessibility.</p>

                <p>Claire is a middle school student who was recently diagnosed with Autism level 2. Her school has been helpful giving her accommodations and updating her IEP, however, her best friend of 3 years does not have any experience or knowledge about autism and has only ever seen it portrayed negatively. Claire wants to use Autism in Plain Sight to help her friend understand her better, and de-mystify autism.</p>
