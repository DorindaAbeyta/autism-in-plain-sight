# autism-in-plain-sight
Personal Website Project for Dorinda Abeyta: Autism in Plain Sight, is a web brochure intended to de-stigmatize Autism Spectrum Disorder. Many online educational resources about Autism are written by non-autistic people, in very clinical language that makes conceptualization of the disorder difficult. This website is written by an Autistic person to foster understanding, outlining the way adaptable traits of autism can look in people, and how to identify and accommodate Autism in everyday life. Included are additinal resources for education, evaluation, literature, and organizations that strive to help actually Autistic people lead fulfilling lives.

This website features Bootstrap framework, with the intention of remaining a static site.

This is a living, breathing project, with the intention of updating and expanding as often as possible, with more information and accessibility features implemented.
